* Andreas Gerler Emacs config
This is a stripped down version of my emacs configuration.
Might be useful for starters.
Have a look at [[bba.org]] as this is the main configuration file.

Enjoy! :-)

A few keybindings of my configuration:

- C-c f9 - Press Ctrl and c followed by f9. Opens a Help file written
  in orgmode.
- C-c f10 - Press Ctrl and c followed by f10. Opens my main config
  file.
- C-x l - Press Ctrl and x followded by l. Wait a moment and you get a
  list of following keybindings to lauch something.
- C-c t - Press Ctrl and c followded by t. Wait a moment and you get a
  list of things to toggle on and off.

After you got used to Emacs you might want to read the bba.org file
bound to C-c f10. You will find interesting modifications like
pressing xx fast instead of M-x.
